The repository for the simulation code that my masters thesis is based on. Also included is a general fitting script 
for hyperfine spectra called fitg.py.
The simulation code is still a work in progress, but is mostly functional. Some tweaks to the theory still need to be implemented.
Once the code is finished, the plan is to create a stand alone application for to be used by the research group after I leave.
